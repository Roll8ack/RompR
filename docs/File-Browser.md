# File Browser

If you want to view your music as a directory tree like some sort of 1990s throwback, you can use the file browser.

Not a lot needs to be said about it with mpd. It shows your local directory tree.

With Mopidy it will show you whatever the backends you have configured provide as browseable directories. Some of these might be non-functional - this is not a RompR issue.

You can download files through your browser by clicking the icon to the left of the file name, provided you have set the path to your local music in the Preferences. With Mopidy this, obviously, only works with local files.
