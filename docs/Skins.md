# Skins

Romp–Ø has multiple 'skins' that change the looks and layout of the interface.

* [Desktop](/RompR/Desktop-Skin) is the default skin on desktop devices. It is the one that most of the example images in these docs are taken from.
* [Phone](/RompR/Phone-Skin) is the default skin on touch screens.
* [Skypotato](/RompR/Skypotato-Skin) is my favourite skin, designed for medium-sized screens.

A default skin will be chosen the first time you open RompR but you can change it at any time from the Configuration menu. Note that if you use an iPad
running iPadOS 13 or later RompR will default to the Desktop skin, because the iPad identifies itself as a Mac, and there's nothing I can do about it.

While the Phone skin is really targeted at touchscreens - espcially small ones - all skins have optimisations for touchscreens,
including using the device's native scrolling and multi-touch.
