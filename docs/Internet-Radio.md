You'll be given a list of stations. You can play a station's highest quality stream just by double-clicking the station name. Opening up the station will give you more information as well as choice of streams in order of quality (highest quality first, lowest bandwidth last).

You can search using any or all of the fields (Name, Country, etc) or browse by Country, Language, and Tag.

You can change the order of the list by using the Order By menu at the top.

## Icecast Radio

Icecast is an open-source alternative to ShoutCast.

Note that while Rompr will allow you to add IceCast stations to Your Radio Stations, the URLs for the stations have a habit of changing and this will make your favourites stop working. There's nothing I can do about this - you'll have to remove the favourite and search for it again. Or find it in one of the other radio panels.

Icecast does not have a 'broswer' panel, because its API really sucks. It will provide seacrh results when you use the search panel.
