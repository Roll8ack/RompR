You'll be given a list of stations. Before you can play a station for the first time you need to choose a stream quality. 'Highest Available Quality' will
always work unless you have a limited bandwitdh connection, in which case chose one of the other settings. Not all stations support all quality settings.

## TuneIn Radio Directory

You can change the order of the list by using the Order By menu at the top.

## Icecast Radio

Icecast is an open-source alternative to ShoutCast.

Note that while Rompr will allow you to add IceCast stations to Your Radio Stations, the URLs for the stations have a habit of changing and this will make your favourites stop working. There's nothing I can do about this - you'll have to remove the favourite and search for it again. Or find it in one of the other radio panels.

Icecast does not have a 'broswer' panel, because its API really sucks. It will provide seacrh results when you use the search panel.
