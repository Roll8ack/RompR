# Contribution Guidelines

The code for RompR is a toy to be played with.
So it changes, frequently and unpredictably according to the whims
of the contributors. This is the philosophy that underpins everything we do.
Coding RompR is a purely creative outlet that we do for enjoyent.
Anything that feels like admin can get stuffed.

We welcome Pull Requests on GitHub but please take note of the following

Please do NOT contribute to RompR if
* You think writing meaningful commit messages matters
* You think formatting is important
* You think we give a flying toss about style guidelines

Please DO contribute to RompR if
* You have a cool new feature you think people will like
* You've looked at the code and decided it's shit and you can do it better

Please make Pull Requests against the 'develop' branch. The 'master' branch is used only for making releases
and PRs submitted against master will be rejected without exception (otherwise it's admin, and we hate admin).
