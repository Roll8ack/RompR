# The Skypotato Skin

I still suck at making up names. Originally this one was supposed to be a bit more iTunes-like,
but it evolved and ended up not being like that, which is a good thing. A few of you may still get the Skypotato reference,
I'll leave it at that.

When browsing albums, the Play Options you will be presented with work the same way as in the [Phone Skin](/RompR/Phone-Skin)

The Panel on the left can be resized by dragging its edge.
On a touch device you can resize the panel by pinching inside it with 2 fingers.
