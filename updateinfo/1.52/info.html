<h3 align="center">Version 1.52 Information</h3>
<ul>
<li>RompR now uses the snapcast JSON-RPC API for Snapcast so you may need to change the port you are using and make sure the JSON-RPC API is enabled in your snapserver configuration. (The default port is 1780)</li>
<li>Mopidy users - if your mopidy-http interface is enabled, RompR can use it for better responsiveness and albumart</li>
<li>Album Art Search now uses Bing instead of Google Images because Google broke my code and Bing's API is better. You'll need to check the docs for how to get this set up</li>
<li>There is a new dependency on php-intl. You should install this package. macOS users, if someone can figure out how to get Locale working on macOS php I'd like to hear</li>
<li>Due to code reorganisation, some of the endpoints used for automation have changed:</li>
<ul>
	<li>The old /rompr/albums.php endpoint has moved to /rompr/api/collection/. Note the trailing '/', this is important</li>
	<li>The old /rompr//player/mpd/postcommand.php endpoint has moved to /rompr/api/player/. Note the trailing '/', this is important</li>
</ul>
<li>All this code reorganisation also means that if you're running romonitor you should restart it after installing this version</li>
</ul>
