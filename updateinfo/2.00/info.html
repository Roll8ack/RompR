<h2 align="center">Version 2.00 Information</h2>

<h3>Big Changes In This Version. Please Read The Following:</h3>

<ul>
<li>This bump in version number reflects a big change in how RompR works internally. This has allowed me to improve
a lot of the functionality, but I cannot possibly test it on every system.</li>
<li>This version introduces the <a href="https://fatg3erman.github.io/Backend-Daemon/">RompR Backend Daemon</a> which replaces romonitor and is now a requirement.
The Daemon performs some tasks that are better not left to the browser. It requires a POSIX operating system
and therefore RompR is no longer supported on Windows. RompR will, on most systems, start this daemon itself so you
shouldn't need to do anything *except* if you were previously running romonitor, in which case you **must** read the link above.</li>
<li>Alarms and the Sleep Timer no longer require a browser to be open, and are therefore now supported in the Phone skin.
As a result of this change though, you will need to recreate any Alarms you had previously configured.</li>
<li>There is now a <a href="https://fatg3erman.github.io/RompR-And-MPD/">Websocket Server</a> that makes the UI more responsive when you're using MPD - essentially it
mimics the part of Mopidy's HTTP interface that RompR uses. There are some pre-requisistes you need for this to work, please
read the link.</li>
<li> <b>DEPRECATION WARNING</b> I am going to remove support for IceCast radio, because the "API" really sucks, it requires PHPQuery to parse it,
and PHP8 pretty much broke PHPQuery, which is now unmaintained. I might change my mind if enough people get in touch and tell me they really like it.
In this release, IceCast is only available when you do a search - the "browser" has been removed.</li>
<li>Now that Mopidy-Spotify is no longer working, and we don't know how long it will take (or if ever) to get a fix,
the rompr/?setup screen has an option to mark all your Spotify tracks as unplayable. They will no longer appear in your collection
 and will not be selected by Personalised Radio stations. Note that selecting this option will force a rescan of your Music Collection.
 You can use the Unplayable Tracks plugin to view all your Spotify tracks, which will give you an easy way to browse them and decide
 which ones you want to buy digital or physical copies of.
 I recommend Bandcamp, where the artist gets a fair share of the money, unlike from Spotify.</li>
 <li>For Mopidy users, all Personalised Radio stations that relied on Spotify support have been disabled. I hope this is temporary, but with
 Mopidy's Spotify support being broken they serve no purpose and are impossible to test.</li>
</ul>
